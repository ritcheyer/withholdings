Withholdings
============
Having recently changed jobs, one of the things I needed to understand was how much my take-home was going to be per-paycheck. Try as I might, I couldn't find a single reliable calculator that displayed the information I was after. Not only that, but each one gave me a different answer! Truth be told, the federal (and state's) calculations for this are extremely confusing and based on several layers of conditional statements (if you're married, if you're withholding extra, if you have kids, etc).

What started out as a bit of a necessity between my wife and I has become a bit of a fun project for me. **Firstly**, I needed something that would reliably provide me with a reliable number for the withholding. **Secondly**, I want to understand where and how the government decides to withhold my earnings. **Thirdly**, I thought maybe this sort of thing might be helpful to anyone else out there in internet-land.

## Calculations Based on
* [Federal tax withholdings](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf) (Info starts at page 43)
* [Social and Medicare](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p15/ar02.html#en_US_2014_publink1000202402)  (Listed in #9)
* [California tax](http://www.edd.ca.gov/pdf_pub_ctr/14methb.pdf)

## Current Assumptions
* You live in California.
* You are a salaried employee (currently doesn't account for hourly or wage earners) and you know your annual gross income.

## Improvements
* Make available to hourly/wage earners
* Make available to people living outside California

## To Do List
* [ ] Compose pseudo-coded formulas
* [ ] Actually code the formulas
* [ ] Allow for additional pre-tax withholdings
* [ ] Pre-tax Insurance Expenses (Medical, Dental, Vision, Life, AD&D, Disability)
* [ ] Pre-tax 401k Contributions
* [ ] Allow for post-tax withholdings (what are some?)
* [ ] Figure out if the order of withholdings matter
* [ ] Calculate net income by pay period (weekly, monthly, bi-monthly)
